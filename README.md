# Ask and recieve

A very simple example about passing data with a RESTful API in Flask.

To run, launch both of the Python services and curl from the terminal, or simply use the *interactive.py* program.

```text
curl 127.0.0.1:5000/ask/ -d "This is a test."
```

TODO
* Implement HTTPS
* Add a HTML/CSS/JS example frontend
